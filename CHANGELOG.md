Cards that check the colors of mana that lands on the opponent battlefield crashes the game, hard to reproduce but happens often enought that I decided to remove them.

### 18/04/19
- *Committed:* Bug fix for the biggest crash and fixes to the primitives

I figured a while ago that the cause of the crash was a rendering issue, not an engine issue, since you could copy spells in the stack if you didn't targeted them. The crash was most likely in ActionStack, just had to follow the trace. It doesn't affect anithing else, that line was trying to render something in the stack that's a permanent but it always had bad ptrs.

(https://github.com/WagicProject/wagic/commit/c3937ce517706a129597cdbfdebecc6b2b5ea467) ([EduardoMunozGomez](https://github.com/EduardoMunozGomez))
### 15/04/19
- *Committed:* Fixing primitives and mayor bugs report

Game crashes when AI plays a card with cost {X} and that targets a player, this cards can be coded around that restriction and still work as per the rules.

The BIGGEST BUG the game has now is that crashes occur when a PERMANENT TARGETS A SPELL IN THE STACK, sometimes the AI can make this cards work (WTH!?) but never the player.

Effects like mirari and similar could be coded so that you don't target the spell but trigger and copy the source of the trigger, look at the code of mirari for this to be more clear.

This effect used to work for many many years I remember  Glen Elendra Archmage being one of my favorite cards back in the day. This bug has been present since god knows when, as early as october 16

Also freaking Lemures caused the AI to just keep repeating the effect so I put a limit on activations on them.

### 15/04/19
- *Committed:* New game modes, bug fixes in primitives, improving AI, new planeswalkers type rule

New rules based on vanguard, 3 new random game modes, one is tribal and one uses any card in the game.

Several corrections and bugs fixes. Cards with x in their cost and that can target any player used to crash the game.

Teaching AI new things and changing values of efficiency.

You can have multiple "Jace" planeswalkers, you can't have two of the exact same name (no two Jace, the mind sculptor).

### 14/02/17
- *Committed:* zpos and zone display

added zone position (adjust dynamically), also inverts the display of
the zone so we always get the top/recent one... the library zpos is
inverted so if we choose to target the top 5 zpos like
target(*[zpos>=5|mylibrary), it will do from top to bottom... this is
only for AI so we can add alternate code for them since they cant use
reveal atm, we can make them target within allowed range...
Also this commit disabled the  new legend and planeswalker rule since it
conflicts with reveal ability, unless I/We figure it out, I recommend to
use the old one...

down to interrupt then do something, if you open a zone like library or
graveyard or exile and you want to interract from the zone there (like
casting spell or doing ability from that zone, you can flick left or
right to close that zone so you can tap for mana or any other extra
costs for that spell, you can open the zone if possible just by tapping
it like it used to.)

added aicode for cards that uses reveal. since reveal cancels for ai,

aicode - use with caution, its very basic atm and you must test each
card that uses it as it can cause crash.
legendary rule moved to game state based effect so it will not conflict
with cards with copy effects and andability. the legendary check applies
only when  legendrule is found.

default token id will be -12345, concat tnum, id will be -1234515 and
the game will try to find the image 1234515t.jpg

### 28/07/16
- *Committed:* changing some of the logic to the previous fixes, we want to avoid using code that looks for specific card names.
currently we have kamiflip as the only defined flip type as it is treated differently from the others. 
but we have room for more if needed now
doublefaced=kamiflip
sets the flip type of a card to the kamiflip style cards. since this is defined on cardprimitive level now, we might be able to do something different from the flipping animation. who knows.

commented out the forcing token triggers, it bypass targetchooser check. still working on a fix for this coming soon.

### 27/07/16
- *Committed:* Fix Flip/Transform Cards

If the card is a copier or a token, it cannot be transformed since it's
not a double face card. Also the copied card must be the "active" part
of a double faced card. Flip cards (kamigawa block) is not restricted by
this since its a single sided card. If the transformed card is cda, take
any damage into account (PT bonus is already in effect for cda)..

### 23/07/16
- *Committed:* corrected my logic for emerge, originally I thought the cost was the same as the original cost, while coding i noticed it can have a completely different cost than the real manacost.

moved the extra cost check for "offerings" to a location before canafford in alternative reacttoclick, the reason for this is that the 2 offering cost we have handle the can afford calls, and even cast the card in the dopay. not placing this before it causes the card to not react to click if there is a different manacost attached to the emerge/kill 
test codes below.
mana={g}{g}{g}
other={emerge}(r}{4} name(emerge)

mana={6}
other={k(giant|mybattlefield)}

fixed memleaks in killoffering code.

note to devs, remember to make diff costs a variable that you can safe_delete, it creates a manacost object that will become a leak otherwise.
do not use it directly as a function.
source->controller()->getManaPool()->canAfford(source->getManaCost()->Diff(target->getManaCost()))
this will leave a memleak every single time ai checks this cost, or a player accesses the cost even if you cant pay it.

### 20/07/16
- *Committed:* removed the changes I made to selectAbility and created a new function which handles sending an ability and card to have AI do the ability of that card.

found a selectability call after blockers that was the cause of a race condition debug assert, but most importantly, the reason AI would sometimes block a creature, then immediately decide not to block. causing it to sometimes take preventable damage, and sometime cause AI to stack a ton of blockers on a single card even tho it did not have a chance to actually kill the creature.
this is still a thing, but wont happen so grossly incorrect now.

- *Committed:* add support for repeater deplete cards.
Scalpelexis
Sphinx's Tutelage
Grindstone
normally I aim for much bigger card groups, but this was requested by one of the only 2 active members we have on the forum.
I'll have the card code for these cards ready when I code eldrich moon set.

to use, use it like any normal depelte except add
name
color
to the front, 
name deplete:4 targetsZone(player)
this will repeat this until the player depletes cards that dont have atleast 2 with the same name.
color deplete:2 target(player)
this will continue to deplete until the player depletes a set of cards that dont share a color with each other lands not included when checking colors.
enjoy.

### 14/07/16
- *Committed:* recoded cascade, the logic was incorrect. also the ability was coded incorrectly. ALL the cards get exiled, then placed on the bottom, the card that cost less is also exiled then MAY be cast otherwise its placed in the library bottom with the rest.
I also now tell AI to ALWAYS use cast card if available. as the effects are always better.

### 09/07/16
- *Committed:* ok found the massive draw, it was trenisphere. the card lords every single card in the game a mana modifier. affinity normally didnt see these issues cause the cards effected are just either in your hand or the source themselves. but when trin was put in play it would cause 120 cards to have to update thier cost, which can not be done in acceptible cpu time. anyways, this should solve the issue.

that card is a desaster, please do not add any more code to support it, though with it in its current state im wondering why its not in supported and is placed in borderline.

### 09/07/16
- *Committed:* going to try only updating affinity() when cards move from anywhere to anywhere to help minimize the calls to this function. this atleast allows me to debug albeit slowly the follow issue ive been working to fix. not sure when this was introduced but it was not happening when i first coded this function. manacost->copy() did not slow the game to a crawl.

anyways, trinisphere and any card containing 
other={H(land[basic]|mybattlefield)}{1} name(Pay /1/ and Return a Basic Land to Hand)

cost such as this with a CD tc.

### 09/07/16
- *Committed:* corrected some logic with computenewcost.
there is a bug im working on with newaffinity and cards that contain targetchoosers with CD tcs. 

experimental change also added with lords. im making the abilities grants by lord forcedalive until the lord is removed from game.
some instances of forcedalive in master primitives did not contain abilities which resolved, meaning they would contenue even though the source had left play.

### 08/07/16
- *Committed:* added a modifier for "tap" for cards that say "enters the battlefield tapped", they are supposed to be tapped when put in play, which mean they should not trigger @tapped(.

for cards with the line or options "do/pay MANA or this card enters the battlefield tapped"
simply change it to tap(noevent)
it will simulate the card being placed into play already tapped.

### 04/07/16
- *Committed:* removed WParsedInt "morethanfour", "plusone","plustwo","plusthree"
added 2 things
first plus/plusend, minus/minusend
written many ways damage:type:*:myhandminus2minusend
would deal damage equal to the cards in my hand -2
damage:type:creature:mybattlefieldplustype:creature:opponentbattlefieldplusend
damage equal to the number of creatures in my battlefield plus the number of creatures in opponents battlefield.

now there are special cases where we need to know the value BEFORE applying multipliers. life: is one of them. I added "math/mathend"

auto=@each opponent upkeep:target(opponent) life:-mathtype:*:myhandminustype:*:opponenthandminusendmathend opponent
in the example above, without "math" the "-" would be used for the first section of the minus parsed int, instead of being applied as a multiplier for the total of the number.

this is extremely flexible, and can contain any Wparsed int in both parts, you can add or subtract and use the differences between to values as the value of the parsedInt.

### 29/06/16
- *Committed:* Pretty huge patch here(sorry old habits never die :( )
lots of changes, many bug fixes,
first
added auto=count(targetchooser)
and countedamount wparsed int
they work together for cards where it is difficult to get working without knowing in advance how many we had ie: exile blah creatures, for each creature you exiled do effect.
auto=count(creature|mybattlefield)
auto=moveto(exile)
auto=draw:countedamount
it takes into account token creatures, which our old methods did not.

second, added "freeze" which is a "frozen" that automatically taps your target for you, for use when nesting or whenever needed where it was difficult to nest the ability with tap included.

added devotion for "iroas"

added reveal:x and scry x
reveal contains optionone/optiononeend ; optiontwo/optiontwoend ; repeat; afterrevealed/afterrevealed end.

this ability has heavy use of targetListIsSet(<amount>) and upto:amount, you MUST be certain that all cards being revealed have an action that removes them from reveal either in the first, second, or 3rd ability.
there are over 300 examples in the new card code, the ability is VERY easy to understand.

scry contains automatic put on top, put on bottom, then scrycore/scrycoreend which is an ability to fire.
it also contains keywords, dontshow which is nested in scrycore, scry reveals, puts on top or bottom, then reveal AGAIN, and does an effect, dontshow eliminates the 2nd revealing.
is also contains "delayed" keyword, which delays the ability until AFTER the core fires.

added bestow. update rules mtg.txt!!!!
examples are in primitives, every bestow card was supported.

added a new lord based on varibles and restrictions
while(restriction{morbid})
while(varible:blah)
this simplifies and expands on this(, allowing you to even use while(cantarget together and check if a card is targetable by the variable. examples are in primitives

added token(by card name)
auto=token(Eldrazi Scion) 
will search primitives and card dats for this card and give it to you as a token.
valid card dat info is still required.

added variable delirium
added restriction madnessplayed to allow checking if the card was played with madness.

added restriction "geared" for checking if a card has equipment on it.

added abilities words
skulk

menace <--cant be blocked except by 2 or more, if you dont block it with 2 or more we automatically unassign the single blocker and the creature is considered not blocked.

nosolo <--cant attack alone

mustblock <---if you dont assign as a blocker, we assign automatically the first thing it can block legally.

changed iscolorless back to "colorless"

enjoy, cards coming soon, theyre coded but im debating on not alpha sorting, cards being added this patch 965 uniques.

there is a section of the commit which was just VS16
