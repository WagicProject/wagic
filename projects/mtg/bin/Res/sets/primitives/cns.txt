    #Missing Cards
    #------------------
    # Conspiracy's
    # Draft styled cards unless ability is relevant to regular play or rarity is decent for the card without the draft ability
    # Will of the Council cards until I find a good way to do this ability
    # Additional Vote cards since if I do Will of the Council they will not work
    # Grenzo, Dungeon Warden (not sure how to do his ability)
    # Marchesa, the Black Rose (can not get third ability to work)
    # Muzzio, Visionary Architect
    # Reign of the Pit (No idea on that one)
    # Parley cards (I am working on a code for it)
