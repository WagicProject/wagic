##FULLY untested
##Please see my Kaladesh possible workaround for energy on Glimmer of Genious (even that one is untested)
##As such, Energy is untested here until me/we might get positive results with my workaround
##Still need some workaround for Menace too! (?)
##("can't be blocked by more than one creature." is hardcoded as ability "oneblocker", before you even try...)
##Pending for test on Nox Gearhulk on KLD: cantbeblockedby(<2>creature)

## Need code for Conspire. What about convoke? Do we have got that? (At least not in my files) -> 
### -> If we manage to develop conspire (either card code or engine code), we should use the chance to develop convoke as well, IMHO.
##Rough idea for conspire/convoke: 
## other=affinity(artifact[-tapped]|mybattlefield) reduce({1})
## autohand=affinity(artifact[-tapped]|mybattlefield) reduce({1})
##Could work if we meld those two somehow. Plus STH like this:
## auto=if paid(alternative) then foreach(artifact[-tapped]|mybattlefield) tap target(artifact[-tapped]|mybattlefield)
## But limit to max generic mana

##Also, no Oracle text, got no internet here, and I don't want to type manually from the cards, I hope, this is understandable.

##I also might work further already after I "upload" this, means this could be outdated and I might have coded more, but this might still be useful if you looks for some ideas of coding or templetes yourself.

## Maybe people who copy this prim and tested cards should make a note of these not working as well as these with working questionable prior testing.
