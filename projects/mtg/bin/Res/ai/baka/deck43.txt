Heartmender (SHM)         *4 # continuously removes -1/-1 counters
#                            # from all others
Kitchen Finks (SHM)       *4 # brings 2 life everytime it persists
Safehold Elite (SHM)      *4 # cheap early defense
Lingering Tormentor (EVE) *4 # attacker with Fear
Rendclaw Trow (EVE)       *4 # has Wither
Gravelgill Axeshark (SHM) *3 # 3/3 creature
Scuzzback Marauders (SHM) *3 # 5/2 attacker
Restless Apparition (EVE) *2 # can get +3/+3 bonus, but does the
#                            # AI use that ability?

Vine Trellis (MRQ)        *4 # cheap defender and mana source

Animate Dead (RV)         *4 # to bring back creatures that were
#                            # killed before the Heartmenders came
#                            # online

# Cards considered, but not included:
# Kithkin Spellduster - has Persist, but is expensive & needs W
# River Kelpie - has Persist, but is expensive & needs blue mana
# Rattleblaze Scarecrow - too expensive for conditional persist
# Wingrattle Scarecrow - only conditional persist
# Gaea's Cradle - AI doesn't use the mana, bad thematic fit
# Cauldron Haze - effect only til end of turn, too short
# Trapjaw Kelpie - very expensive, AI doesn't use flash
# Sadistic Glee - Might help in a deck where so many creatures go
#   to the Graveyard, then again it might not if it's the
#   enchanted creature that dies. The point is currently moot
#   though since the AI casts the spell on its opponents anyway
# Vulturous Zombie - no Persist, too expensive
# Infest - perhaps too dangerous as long as no Heartmender in play
# Harbinger of Night - definitely too dangerous

# Cards removed from the deck:
# none

# Notes:
# Doesn't perform as well as I'd like it to. The deck is very
# dependent on the Heartmenders, and sometimes they take a long
# time to come out. Suggestions?
#
# Animate Dead seems to choose targets randomly and sometimes
# picks bad ones. But it still works well in this deck if it
# targets creatures with Persist, because when these get killed
# while they are animated dead, they return from the graveyard
# without the animation enchantment. It would be nice if "Animate
# Dead" could prioritize the Kitchen Finks as targets.
