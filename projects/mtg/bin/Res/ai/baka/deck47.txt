# Cards considered, but not included:
# Wirecat - mechanical cat doesn't fit the theme
# Red cats: Canyon Wildcat, Guma, Raging Cougar, Sabretooth Tiger,
#   Whild Jhovall: No synergy with green or white
# Jhovall Queen - used as a mount, so not really a "wild" cat
# Wild Nacatl - wields a weapon, so not really wild either
# Sabertooth Nishoba - is a cat warrior
# Panther Warriors - dito
# Giant Growth - AI doesn't seem to use it at all
# Whitemane Lion - AI can't choose well which creature to return


# Cards removed from the deck:
# Predatory Hunger - This card was a fantastic fit for theme,
#   focus, and power. Unfortunately the AI casts it on its
#   opponent's creatures. Swap this card back in as soon as this
#   problem gets solved.

# Notes:
# Flavor deck.
