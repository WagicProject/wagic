# Cards considered, but not included:
# Burning Cloak - AI would kill its own creatures
# Canyon Drake - flyers would be nice, but too expensive
# Crown of Flames - Firebreathing is more foolproof for the AI
# Dragon Whelp - Furnace Whelp is more foolproof
# Desert Drake - Furnace Whelp is better for the same cost
# Immolation - AI can't decide whether it'll help or destroy the
#   enchanted creature
# Lizard warrior - is not a viashino, and a viashino with
#   identical values exists
# Mass Hysteria - Emblem of the Warmind fits the theme better and
#   doesn't help the enemy
# Pyroclasm - AI would kill its own creatures
# Viashino Skeleton - other viashinos wouldn't associate with it
# Kindled Fury - lasts only until end of turn, often wasted by AI
# Double Cleave - lasts only until end of turn, often wasted by AI
# Reflexes - first strike already provided by Flaming Sword

# Cards removed from the deck:
# Bravado - AI casts it on opponent's creatures
# Seething Song - mana acceleration would be great, bit the AI
#   doesn't use the mana
# Viashino Sandscout - AI doesn't understand that it will return
#   to owner's hand, may enchant it
# Viashino Bladescout - removed from Wagic

# Notes:
# Flavor deck.
