Zuberi, Golden Feather (MIR) *2

Suntail Hawk (10E)        *4 # cheap flyer
Courier Hawk (RAV)        *4 # cheap flyer
Wild Griffin (10E)        *3 # balanced 3-drop flyer
Griffin Sentinel (M10)    *3 # defensive 3-drop flyer
Razorfoot Griffin (M10)   *2 # offensive 4-drop flyer
Ekundu Griffin (MIR)      *2 # same as Razorfoot Griffin
Spotted Griffin (POR)     *2 # defensive 4-drop flyer
Divebomber Griffin (RAV)  *1 # only 1, AI doesn't use ability
Windbrisk Raptor (SHM)    *1 # not a griffin, but a bird, and
#                            # fits well as an endgame surprise

Moat (LEG)                *4 # 4 because it's important for this
#                            # deck to keep strong attackers away

Blessing (RV)             *2 # \  6 enchantments to reinforce the
Holy Strength (10E)       *2 #  > holy nature of the griffins -
Honor of the Pure (M10)   *2 # /  and the creatures need buffs
Swords to Plowshares (RV) *2 # reinforces the aggresiveness of
#                            # the griffin theme, and stalls the
#                            # the game until Moat comes in

Plains (10E) *24

# Cards considered, but not included:
# Loyal Gyrfalcon - too expensive for a non-griffin in this deck
# Crusade - Weaker than Honor of the Pure

# Cards removed from the deck:
# Welkin Hawk - not a griffin, and can crash the game in 0.8.1
# Righteousness - AI doesn't use it
# Teremko Griffin - Banding removed from Wagic

# Notes:
# Flavor deck, might be more competitive if it included bird
# soldiers and global enchantments (Crusade, Glorious Anthem), but
# I wanted to limit the theme of this deck to "animal" griffins
# and birds, which excluded the "civilized" Aven and the more
# civilized enchantments.
