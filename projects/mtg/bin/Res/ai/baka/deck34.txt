# Cards considered, but not included:
# Orcish Oriflamme - would match the deck's focus of
#   strengthening the creatures, but is too expensive. Perhaps add
#   it when mana acceleration is possible for this deck.

# Cards removed from he deck:
# 3 x Bravado (USG) (ID 5848)
# The card's name and illustration don't really fit the "kobold"
# theme, but the effect (strength through numbers) definitely
# does.
# Removed because the AI casts it on its opponent's creatures.

# 4 x Brightstone Ritual (ONS) (ID 39846)
# for mana acceleration
# Removed because the AI doesn't use the mana.
# Also ... only works with goblins. Duh. *blush*

Keldon Warlord (5ED) * 2
#   Doesn't fit the theme too well (would a Keldon Warlord really
#   work as a mercenary for a Kobold Overlord?), but without it
#   the deck would be too weak, and a deck full of weak
#   creatures is exactly the environment where a Keldon Warlord
#   thrives.
