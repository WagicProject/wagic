Mountain (10E)              *20
Kher Keep (TSP)             *2 # produces kobold tokens
Crimson Kobolds (LEG)       *4
Crookshank Kobolds (LEG)    *4
Kobold Drill Sergeant (LEG) *4
Kobold Overlord (LEG)       *4
Kobold Taskmaster (LEG)     *4
Kobolds of Kher Keep (LEG)  *4
Battle Squadron (MRQ)       *2 # to have a flyer in the deck
Keldon Warlord (RV)         *2
#   Doesn't fit the theme too well (would a Keldon Warlord really
#   work as a mercenary for a Kobold Overlord?), but without it
#   the deck would be too weak, and a deck full of weak
#   creatures is exactly the environment where a Keldon Warlord
#   thrives.
Wheel of Fortune (RV)       *1
#To get a new hand (hopefully) full of cheap kobolds once the
#previous hand has been used up. Only 1 because it's
#restricted.
Slate of Ancestry (ONS)     *2
#To draw more cards (check whether the AI overuses it and
#decks itself out)
Howling Mine (10E)          *4
Mob Justice (STH)           *3  # finisher

#
# Cards considered, but not included:
# Orcish Oriflamme - would match the deck's focus of
#   strengthening the creatures, but is too expensive. Perhaps add
#   it when mana acceleration is possible for this deck.
#
# Cards removed from he deck:
# 3 x Bravado (USG) (ID 5848)
# The card's name and illustration don't really fit the "kobold"
# theme, but the effect (strength through numbers) definitely
# does.
# Removed because the AI casts it on its opponent's creatures.
#
# 4 x Brightstone Ritual (ONS) (ID 39846)
# for mana acceleration
# Removed because the AI doesn't use the mana.
# Also ... only works with goblins. Duh. *blush*
