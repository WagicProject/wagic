Glen Elendra Archmage (EVE) *4 # ability is currently buggy ...

Heartmender (SHM)         *4 # continuously removes -1/-1 counters
                             # from all others
Kitchen Finks (SHM)       *4 # brings 2 life everytime it persists
Safehold Elite (SHM)      *4 # cheap early defense
Gravelgill Axeshark (SHM) *2 # 3/3 creature
Kithkin Spellduster (EVE) *2 # Enchantment removal
Restless Apparition (EVE) *4 # can get +3/+3 bonus
River Kelpie (SHM)        *2 # card drawer, only *2 to prevent the
                             # AI from decking itself out

Oona's Gatewarden (SHM)   *4 # good cheap defense & fits the theme
Plumeveil (SHM)           *2 # great defense & fits the theme

Wrath of God (10E)        *4 # destroys all creatures

Plains (10E) *14
Island (10E) *10


# Cards considered, but not included:
# Rendclaw Trow - has persist & wither, but needs BG mana
# Lingering Tormentor - has persist * Fear, but needs B mana
# Scuzzback Marauders - has persist & high attack, but needs BR
#   mana. High attack not necessary once Wrath of God is cast
# Rattleblaze Scarecrow - too expensive for conditional persist
# Wingrattle Scarecrow - only conditional persist
# Gaea's Cradle - AI doesn't use the mana, dubious thematic fit
# Cauldron Haze - effect only til end of turn, too short
# Trapjaw Kelpie - very expensive, AI doesn't use flash

# Cards removed from the deck:
# none

# Notes:
# The AI seemed pretty reluctant to cast Wrath in the test runs,
# although it did use the card from time to time
#
# River Kelpie: The AI is in danger of decking itself out if it
# has many Wither creatures, 2 Kelpies, and casts Wrath of God.
# I already reduced the Kelpies after the AI had to draw 40 cards
# in one test run, but even 2 may be too much. Will have to be
# watched.
#
# Restless Apparition: May actually prevent the Heartmender and
# Wrath of God from being played if the AI uses its plains to pump
# the apparition before checking whether it could use those plains
# to play spells. This will have to be watched too.
