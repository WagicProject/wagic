# Cards considered, but not included:
# Shepherd of the Rot - *much* too dangerous for the AI in this
#   deck
# Graveborn Muse - dito
# Empty the Catacombs - would weaken the Soulless One
# Dauthi Ghoul - too expensive for a 1/1 creature in a
#   non-shadow deck
# Zombify - too expensive, a Zombie deck has cheaper means
# Cruel Revival - too expensive
# Dreg Reaver - Mass of Ghouls better for same cost
# Zombie Goliath - Mass of Ghouls better for same cost
# Gluttonous Zombie - Mass of Ghouls has better power, fear
#   won't work against black or artifacts
# Dross Prowler - Severed Legion better for same cost
# Scathe Zombies - Severed Legion better for same cost
# Bog Raiders - Swampwalk provided by Zombie Master, so B.R. is
#   weaker than Severed Legion for same cost
# Phyrexian Ghoul - AI can't handle sacrifice decisions well
# Nantuko Husk - dito
# Recover - too expensive
# Disentomb - the Lord of the Undead will do most of the Raising
# Raise Undead - dito
# Tortured Existence - dito
# Dross Crocodile - too expensive
# Gravedigger - too expensive
# Spineless Thug - cheap, but can't block
# Feeding Frenzy - nice but too expensive
# Sadistic Glee - AI casts it on opponent's creatures
# Unholy Grotto, Volrath's Stronghold - would weaken Soulless One
# Haunted Crossroads - would weaken Soulless One

# Cards removed from the deck:
# Accursed Centaur - sacrifices itself
# Dark Ritual - AI doesn't use the mana

# Notes:
#
# Slow buildup, and no synergy until the 3-drop creatures come in.
# Would profit a lot from Dark Ritual if it worked.
