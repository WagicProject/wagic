# Cards considered, but not included:
# Cinderbones: Expensive and weak in this deck
# Sootstoke Kindler - AI can't choose target well
# Fulminator Mage - most lands of player will be basic for a while
# Midnight Covenant - buggy in 0.8.1

# Cards removed from the deck:
# none

# Notes:
# The Soul Snuffers may have to be removed since the AI often
# hurts itself with them.
#
# This is a pure black deck, it doesn't explore most of the
# potential red/black synergies. I'd like to do that as well, but
# I'd want the Ashenmoor Liege as a central card in that deck, and
# that card isn't implemented yet. Hence, the deck is black and
# the central creature is a black creature.
