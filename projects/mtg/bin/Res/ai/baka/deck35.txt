# Land(s)
Forest (8ED) * 12
Island (8ED) * 3
Mountain (8ED) * 6
Plains (8ED) * 3

# Creature(s)
Bonesplitter Sliver (TSP) * 4 # nice cumulative +2/+0 bonus
Crystalline Sliver (H09) * 1  # Shroud is nice, especially in a deck with no non-creature spells
Fury Sliver (TSP) * 2         # gives double strike, only 2 because it's a 6-drop creature
Gemhide Sliver (TSP) * 4      # Additional mana source to get Might Slivers out faster
Heart Sliver (H09) * 2        # gives Haste
Horned Sliver (TPR) * 3       # gives Trample, also 2/2 isn't bad for a 3-drop creature that others will pump
Might Sliver (TSP) * 4        # nice cumulative +2/+2 bonus
Muscle Sliver (H09) * 4       # cheap and the +1/+1 bonus is cumulative and can't be misused by the AI
Shadow Sliver (TSP) * 1       # might be great or bad - thrown in as an element of surprise
Spined Sliver (H09) * 2       # gives Rampage
Spinneret Sliver (TSP) * 3    # 2/2 Sliver for only 2 mana, also gives Reach to all slivers, which is good because we only have
#                             # two Winged Slivers in the deck, and those might not even be played because we have few Islands.
Talon Sliver (*) * 3          # gives First Strike
Watcher Sliver (TSP) * 1      # nice cumulative +0/+2 bonus, but too expensive to have more of them, and we have 3 plains in the deck
Winged Sliver (H09) * 2       # gives Flying

# Cards considered, but not included:
# Basal Sliver - AI too eager to sacrifice
# Clot Sliver - would be the only black sliver left after Basal
#  Sliver was taken out; also: AI not too smart with regeneration
# Sedge Sliver - no swamps in deck (since all black slivers were
#   taken out)
# Firewake Sliver - AI too eager to sacrifice
# Mnemonic Sliver - AI too eager to sacrifice
# Telekinetic Sliver - AI doesn't make smart tapping definitions
# Quilled Sliver - AI can't target ability in a smart way
# Armored Sliver - AI can't decide well when to use ability
# Barbed Sliver - AI can't decide well when to use ability
# Venser's Sliver - doesn't strengthen other slivers
# Sliversmith - doesn't profit from other slivers. Its tokens
#   do, but the AI isn't smart in deciding which cards to discard
# Metallic Sliver - is cheap, but doesn't strengthen other slivers
# Victual Sliver - AI too eager to sacrifice
# Battering Sliver - effect already provided by cheaper Horned Sl.
# Sliver Queen - AI can't handle 5-color deck
# Reflex Sliver - Heart Sliver has same effect for lower cost
# Sinew Sliver - good +1/+1 bonus, but only few plains in this
#   deck, and red/green slivers provide same or similar effects
# Synchronous Sliver - Vigilance is nice, but sliver is blue and
#   pretty expensive
#
# Cards removed from the deck:
# 20 dual lands - AI only uses the first "auto" rule for each
#   dual land. Therefore none of the chosen lands produced green
#   mana, the AI treated most dual lands as islands, and the deck
#   never got sliver production started.
