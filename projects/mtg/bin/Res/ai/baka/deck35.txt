#
#

Winged Sliver (TMP)  *2 # gives Flying

Horned Sliver (TMP)  *3 # gives Trample, also 2/2 isn't bad for a
#                       # 3-drop creature that others will pump 

Muscle Sliver (TMP)  *4 # cheap and the +1/+1 bonus is cumulative
#                       # and can't be misused by the AI

Heart Sliver (TMP)   *2 # gives Haste

Talon Sliver (TMP)   *3 # gives First Strike

Watcher Sliver (TSP) *1 # nice cumulative +0/+2 bonus, but too
#                       # expensive to have more of them, and we
#                       # only have 3 plains in the deck

Shadow Sliver (TSP) *1  # might be great or bad - thrown in as
#                       # an element of surprise

Crystalline Sliver (STH) *1 # Shroud is nice, especially in a
#                           # deck with no non-creature spells

Bonesplitter Sliver (TSP) *4  # nice cumulative +2/+0 bonus

Fury Sliver (TSP) *2    # gives double strike, only 2 because
#                       # it's a 6-drop creature

Might Sliver (TSP) *4   # nice cumulative +2/+2 bonus
#
Spined Sliver (STH) *2  # gives Rampage

Spinneret Sliver (TSP) *3  # 2/2 Sliver for only 2 mana, also
# gives Reach to all slivers, which is good because we only have
# two Winged Slivers in the deck, and those might not even be
# played because we have few Islands.

Gemhide Sliver (TSP) *4 # Additional mana source to get Might
#                       # Slivers out faster

Forest (M10)   *12      # (most slivers in the deck are green)
Island (M10)   *3       # only 4 blue creatures in the deck
Mountain (M10) *6
Plains (M10)   *3       # only 5 white creatures in the deck

#
# Cards considered, but not included:
# Basal Sliver - AI too eager to sacrifice
# Clot Sliver - would be the only black sliver left after Basal
#  Sliver was taken out; also: AI not too smart with regeneration
# Sedge Sliver - no swamps in deck (since all black slivers were
#   taken out)
# Firewake Sliver - AI too eager to sacrifice
# Mnemonic Sliver - AI too eager to sacrifice
# Telekinetic Sliver - AI doesn't make smart tapping definitions
# Quilled Sliver - AI can't target ability in a smart way
# Armored Sliver - AI can't decide well when to use ability
# Barbed Sliver - AI can't decide well when to use ability
# Venser's Sliver - doesn't strengthen other slivers
# Sliversmith - doesn't profit from other slivers. Its tokens
#   do, but the AI isn't smart in deciding which cards to discard
# Metallic Sliver - is cheap, but doesn't strengthen other slivers
# Victual Sliver - AI too eager to sacrifice
# Battering Sliver - effect already provided by cheaper Horned Sl.
# Sliver Queen - AI can't handle 5-color deck
# Reflex Sliver - Heart Sliver has same effect for lower cost
# Sinew Sliver - good +1/+1 bonus, but only few plains in this
#   deck, and red/green slivers provide same or similar effects
# Synchronous Sliver - Vigilance is nice, but sliver is blue and
#   pretty expensive
#
# Cards removed from the deck:
# 20 dual lands - AI only uses the first "auto" rule for each
#   dual land. Therefore none of the chosen lands produced green
#   mana, the AI treated most dual lands as islands, and the deck
#   never got sliver production started.
