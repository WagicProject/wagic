#Test to confirm that "aslongas" in combination with ">" or "<" does not work.
#You control 4 arifacts and Auriok Sunchaser. It is 3/3 due to its Metalcraft bonus (+2/+2).
#1 of the 4 artifacts gets destroyed by Shatter. Auriok Sunchaser should stay 3/3 because there are still enough artifacts on your side,
#but in fact, Metalcraft is turned off, so Shock can kill Auriok Sunchaser.
